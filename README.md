Hotel Booking Cancellation Analysis
Project Overview

This project analyzes hotel booking data to identify patterns and key factors contributing to booking cancellations in City Hotel and Resort Hotel. The goal is to provide data-driven insights and business recommendations to reduce cancellations, improve occupancy rates, and increase revenue.

This project demonstrates essential Data Analyst skills including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), data visualization, and business insight generation using Python.

Business Problem

High booking cancellation rates negatively impact hotel revenue, occupancy, and operational planning. Hotel management lacks clear insights into cancellation behavior, making it difficult to optimize pricing strategies and booking policies.

This project analyzes historical booking data to identify cancellation trends and recommend strategies to minimize cancellations.

Objectives

Identify overall cancellation rate

Compare cancellation rate between City Hotel and Resort Hotel

Analyze cancellation trends by month, country, and market segment

Examine the relationship between ADR (Average Daily Rate) and cancellations

Provide business recommendations to reduce cancellation rate
